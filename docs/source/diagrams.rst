Data Intepretation
====================


After POMSimulator has run its simulation in **section 1**, and then treated this information, we can now visualize the results.
For this purpose we have three different programs, located in the `utilities/` directory.

- ``plot_reac_map.py`` : With this program user can visualitze the chemical reaction network in a 2D or 3D map
- ``plot_speciation_diagram.py``: This program plots the calculated concentrations in **monometal_speciation.py**
- ``plot_phase_diagram.py``: This program plots the calculated concentrations in **monometal_phase.py**

Throughout this program, we can plot the chemical reaction network. We will need to
pass the same parameters as in the simulation file, to reproduce the exact system.
User can then choose between a 2D or 3D plot and whether all reactions are included
or only the reactions in a particular speciation model. Inside `utilities/`: ``plot_reac_map.py``

Moreover some parameters of the plot can be tuned, from the plotting_dict. Some of these parameters are:

- ``node_color``
- ``x_axis, y_axis and z_axis labels``
- ``plot_title``
- ``colormap``

When the plot function is called, user must choose between ``Reaction_Map_2D_monometal
or Reaction_Map_3D_monometal``. User, also has to choose which reactions are plotted.
If user only selects a single speciation model, the `All_models` flag must be set to ``False`` and
the proper reactions must be passed (idx_new,e_new and type_new). Otherwise, ``All_models`` flag
must be set to ``True`` and the reactions passed must be ``Reac_idx,Reac_energy and Reac_type``.
To select a particular speciation model, the `target_model` variable must be changed into the specific model number,
which can be extracted from the **scale_constants** output file. To plot speciation diagrams, only needed the concentration
array calculated in ``monometal_speciation.py`` is needed. As a result, a plot like the
following one can be obtained running `plot_speciation_diagram.py` inside `utilities/` :

As in previous section, to plot phase diagrams, only the concentrations array computed at different values of the total concentration, generated by ``monometal_phase.py`` is needed.
As a result of running `plot_phase_diagram.py` inside `utilities/`, a plot like the following one can be obtained:
